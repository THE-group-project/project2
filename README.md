# How this project came to be…
  * Eric suggested that we create a shelter or safe house informational site for young adults similarly to a mobile app found on the app     store that was very basic and we felt that we could add further improvements to it. However one thing we wanted to utilize in our         website was an API and we felt that there was no API available to use for shelters/safe houses. We were going to utilize Google map’s     API for search query of shelters/safe house nearby but we felt it would be too similar to our previous project so we scrapped that idea.   We shifted gears and found that most search queries were bring back a lot of animal shelters and so here we are.
  
# What is the purpose of this project?

# What are the benefits of pet adoption?

  * Adopting a pet comes with numerous advantages including:

  * You’re saving a life. Millions of healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home. When you adopt your        pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.
  * Many adoptable pets are already trained.
  * When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament. You also already know their full grown       size!
  * An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs         to help prepare the pet for a new home.
