# What are the benefits of pet adoption?

  * Adopting a pet comes with numerous advantages including:

  * You’re saving a life. Millions of healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home. When you adopt your        pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.
  * Many adoptable pets are already trained.
  * When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament. You also already know their full grown       size!
  * An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs         to help prepare the pet for a new home.
