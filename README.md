##What are the benefits of pet adoption?
  *Adopting a pet comes with numerous advantages including:

  *You’re saving a life. Millions of healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home. When you adopt your pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.
  *Many adoptable pets are already trained.
  *When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament. You also already know their full grown size!
  *An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs to help prepare the pet for a new home.
